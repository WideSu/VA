```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE,
                      eval=TRUE,

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R pacakges. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.
```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse','ggdist','gghalves')
for(p in packages){
if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
install.packages(p)
}
library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

The code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment using read_csv() function of readr package.
```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("./data/Exam_data.csv")
```
## ggplot2

- <span style="color: DodgerBlue">Data</span>: The dataset being plotted. 
- <span style="color: DodgerBlue">Aesthetics</span>: take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency. 
- <span style="color: DodgerBlue">Geometrics</span>: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line. 
<img width="485" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923423/164900374-6f6386dd-38db-49cd-a8a2-685b7fe35ca0.png">
- <span style="color: DodgerBlue">Facets</span>: split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).
- <span style="color: DodgerBlue">Statistics</span>: statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).
Coordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic. 
- <span style="color: DodgerBlue">Themes</span>: modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.

### Aethetics
The code chunk on the right add the aesthetic element into the plot.
Notice that ggplot includes the x-axis and the axis's label.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x= MATHS))
```

### Geometric Objects: geom_bar
The code chunk below plots a bar chart.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
aes(x=RACE)) +
geom_bar()
```

### Geometric Objects: geom_dotplot
In a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
  aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)
```

The code chunk below performs the following two steps:

- scale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and 
- binwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) + 
  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5, dotsize = 0.5) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL)
```

### Geometric Objects: geom_histogram

In the code chunk below, geom_histogram() is used to a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
aes(x = MATHS)) +
geom_histogram()
```

#### Modifying a geometric object by changing geom()

In the code chunk below, 

- bins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20, 
- fill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and color argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")
```

#### Modifying a geometric object by changing aes()

- The code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using sub- group of aesthetic().
- Note that this approach can be used to **colour, fill and alpha** of the geometric.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
aes(x= MATHS,
fill = GENDER)) +
geom_histogram(bins=20,
color="grey30")
```

### Geometric Objects: geom-density
geom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram. 

It is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution. 

The code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) + 
  geom_density()
```

The code chunk below plots two kernel
density lines by using **colour** or **fill** arguments of **aes()**
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS, colour = GENDER)) + 
  geom_density()
```

### Geometric Objects: geom_boxplot
The code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
aes(y = MATHS,
x= GENDER)) +
geom_boxplot()
```

**Notches** are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the **medians** are different. The code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

### geom objects can be combined
The code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both **geom_boxplot()** and **geom_point()**.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
      aes(y = MATHS,
      x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(position="jitter",
size = 0.5)
```

### Geometric Objects: geom_violin
Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it's easier to compare several distributions since they're placed side by side. The code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
aes(y = MATHS,
x= GENDER)) +
geom_violin()
```

### Geometric Objects: geom_violin() and geom_boxplot()
The code chunk below combined a violin plot and a boxplot to show the distribution of Maths scores by gender.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
aes(y = MATHS,
x= GENDER)) +
geom_violin(fill="light blue") +
geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5)
```

### Geometric Objects: geom_point()
The code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
aes(x= MATHS,
y=ENGLISH)) +
geom_point()
```

## Statistics, stat

- The Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example: 
  - frequency of values of a variable (bar graph) 
  - a mean 
  - a confidence limit 
- There are two ways to use these functions: 
  - add a stat_() function and override the default geom, or
  - add a geom_()/ function and override the default stat.

### Working with stat - the stat_summary() method
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  stat_summary(geom = "point", 
               fun.y="mean", 
               colour ="red", 
               size=4)
```

### Working with stat - the geom() method
The code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point(stat="summary", 
             fun.y="mean", 
             colour ="red", 
             size=4)
```

### How to add a best fit curve on a scatterplot?
In the code chunk below, geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot. 
- The default method used is loess.
```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(size=0.5)
```

The default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.
